### Description
This is the learning project to practice React :)

Imagine you want to split the restaraunt (or any other kind of) bill with your friend. However, you might be afraid to forget in the long run who owes who. That is when this site comes in handy. 

The demo of the app contains 3 friends with specified balance. You can add your friends by clicking an "Add friend" button or you can choose an existing friend to split the bill with. 
By filling up a form and choosing who pays, the owing balance updates by displaying different messages according to your situation.
